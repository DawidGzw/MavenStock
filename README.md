MavenStock
==========

Maven project created by netbeans IDE

There are few steps needed to configure project:

1. This project uses Websocekts API, so you might need to modify String in /resources/javascript/chartWebsite/chartWebsocketDef.js
  if you want to change client URL to the server. (default - 'localhost:8080/MavenStock/shareprovider')
2. You need to change annotation in java file in ejb.services.DataUpdateService.java if you want to provide real stock prices data in application
  insted of those generated by app randomly. You should change @RandomFiller annotation to @MoneyFiller to inject StockDataFiller instance that uses data from money.pl website. 
3. If you already have stock indexes data in database modify /WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml file, to disable automatic data update in deploy phase - 
  change envirnoment entry value with name 'update' from 'true' to 'false'.
4. There is TimerService in the application, so you must cofigure application server to respect that. If the appliation server won't create table, you will need to create it manualy (examle Derby database SQL script): 
  CREATE TABLE glassfish."EJB__TIMER__TBL" (
"CREATIONTIMERAW"      BIGINT        NOT NULL,
"BLOB"                 BLOB,
"TIMERID"              VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
"CONTAINERID"          BIGINT        NOT NULL,
"OWNERID"              VARCHAR(255)  ,
"STATE"                INTEGER       NOT NULL,
"PKHASHCODE"           INTEGER       NOT NULL,
"INTERVALDURATION"     BIGINT        NOT NULL,
"INITIALEXPIRATIONRAW" BIGINT        NOT NULL,
"LASTEXPIRATIONRAW"    BIGINT        NOT NULL,
"SCHEDULE"             VARCHAR(255)  ,
"APPLICATIONID"        BIGINT        NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT "PK_EJB__TIMER__TBL" PRIMARY KEY ("TIMERID"));
